\section{Implementation (50pt)}

You need to implement the forward pass and backward pass for \texttt{Linear}, \texttt{ReLU}, \texttt{Sigmoid}, \texttt{MSE loss}, and \texttt{BCE loss} in the attached \texttt{mlp.py} file.
We provide three example test cases \texttt{test1.py}, \texttt{test2.py}, \texttt{test3.py}.
We will test your implementation with other hidden test cases, so please create your own test cases to make sure your implementation is correct.

\textbf{Recommendation}: Go through this \href{https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html}{Pytorch tutorial} to have a thorough understanding of Tensors.

Extra instructions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Please use Python version $\geq 3.7$ and PyTorch version $1.7.1$.
We recommend you to use Miniconda the manage your virtual environment.
\item We will put your \texttt{mlp.py} file under the same directory of the hidden test scripts and use the command \texttt{python hiddenTestScriptName.py} to check your implementation.
So please make sure the file name is \texttt{mlp.py} and it can be executed with the example test scripts we provided.
\item You are not allowed to use PyTorch autograd functionality in your implementation.
\item Be careful about the dimensionality of the vector and matrix in PyTorch.
It is not necessarily follow the the Math you got from part 1.
\end{enumerate}
