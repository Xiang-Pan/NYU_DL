The goal of homework 2 is to get you to work with convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. 

In the theoretical part, you will work on figuring out how backpropagation works in these networks. In part 2, we will implement and train them.

In part 1, you should submit all your answers in a pdf file. As before, we recommend using \LaTeX. 

For part 2, you will implement some neural networks by adding your code to the provided ipynb file. 

As before, please use numerator layout.

The due date of homework 2 is 5:00pm \texttt{03/04}.
Submit the following files in a zip file \texttt{your\_net\_id.zip} through NYU Brightspace:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{hw2\_theory.pdf}
\item \texttt{hw2\_cnn.ipynb}
\item \texttt{hw2\_rnn.ipynb}
\item \texttt{08-seq\_classification.ipynb}
\end{itemize}

The following behaviors will result in penalty of your final score:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 10\% penalty for submitting your file without using the correct naming format (including naming the zip file, PDF file or python file wrong, adding extra files in the zip folder, like the testing scripts in your zip file). 
\item 20\% penalty for late submission within the first 24 hours after the deadline. We will not accept any late submission after the first 24 hours.
\item 20\% penalty for code submission that cannot be executed following the steps we mentioned.
\end{enumerate}
